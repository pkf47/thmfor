  <p><strong>faruqh – PURCHASED WP Residence – Real Estate WordPress Theme</strong><br />
   I want to thank you guys for this theme. Very awesome work. We expanded it with Buddypress and Woocommerce and came up with this:  We were able to launch or tours and excursion site in two weeks. Did some customization, which was made alot easier because of the care taken in how the template was professionally layed out, from the code side to the UX side. The core is solid and saved us an enormous amount of work.</p>
